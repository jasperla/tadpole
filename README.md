tadpole IRC-bot
===============

Introduction
------------

In many (every?) IRC channel dozens of links get posted every single
day. This bot helps you to record those links and make them available
for future reference.

Eventually tadpole will be able to store the links in a Redis database,
which can then be retrieved and done something fancy with using another tool. For now this is an interesting tool to learn CoffeeScript with.

ToDo
----

* Support storing URIs into Redis
* Nicer HTML output
