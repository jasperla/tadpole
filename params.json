{"body":"tadpole IRC-bot\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn many (every?) IRC channel dozens of links get posted every single\r\nday. This bot helps you to record those links and make them available\r\nfor future reference.\r\n\r\nEventually tadpole will be able to store the links in a Redis database,\r\nwhich can then be retrieved and done something fancy with using another tool. For now this is an interesting tool to learn CoffeeScript with.\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Support storing URIs into Redis\r\n* Nicer HTML output\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse <jasper@humppa.nl>\r\n\r\nDistributed under the BSD license (see the file COPYING).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
